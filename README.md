# PEMDAS
## Prediction Ensemble Model for Dengue Analytics in Stream
PEMDAS is a robust ensemble machine learning model for the real-time prediction of dengue in Quezon City, Philipipnes. It integrates meteorological data (namely precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) and Google tearch trends data in order to make predictions. The model is built using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (H-W ES).

Built in PyTorch.
